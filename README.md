# Ant Colony Optimization for EVRPTW 🌐

Welcome Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) project, where advanced algorithms and electric vehicles meet to solve the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (EVRPTW). 🚚⏱️

## Project Overview 📜

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of ACO algorithms, designed to optimize routing paths for electric vehicles considering specific time windows and recharging requirements.

## Documentation 📖

For more detailed information and usage instructions, check out our [documentation](/EVRPTW/docs/).

## Installation and Dependencies 🔧

Ensure Python is installed along with the following packages:
- `numpy`
- `dask`
- `pandas`
- `yaml`
- `csv`

**Steps for Installation**:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   - Use the command `git clone https://github.com/F-a-b-r-i-z-i-o/Ant_Colony_Optimization_for_Evrptw.git` to clone the EVRPTW repository to your local machine.
2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**:
   - Navigate to the EVRPTW directory (`cd EVRPTW`).
   - Create a virtual environment named `env` within this directory. Use the command `python3 -m venv env`.
   - Activate the virtual environment using the `script.sh` script with the command `. ./active_venv.sh`.
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install required dependencies by executing `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. This will install all the necessary packages as listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

By following these steps, you'll set up the necessary environment to run the Ant Colony Optimization simulations for EVRPTW.
